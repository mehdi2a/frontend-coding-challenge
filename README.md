# Frontend Coding Challenge

## Idea of the App

The task is to implement a small webapp that will list the most starred Github repos that were created in the last 30 days. You'll be fetching the sorted JSON data directly from the Github API .

## Features implemented

    [x] As a User I should be able to list the most starred Github repos that were created in the last 30 days.
    [x] As a User I should see the results as a list. One repository per row.
    [x] As a User I should be able to see for each repo/row the following details :
          [x] Repository name
          [x] Repository description
          [x] Number of stars for the repo.
          [x] Number of issues for the repo.
          [x] Username and avatar of the owner.
    [x] As a User I should be able to keep scrolling and new results should appear (pagination).
